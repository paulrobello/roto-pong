# Roto Pong - Future Ideas

## Block Effects

### ✨ Shimmer Effect (Priority: A)
- Occasional animated shine/sparkle on blocks
- Could be random or wave-based across the arena
- Different shimmer styles per block type

### 🟢 Jello Block (Priority: High)
- NURBS-style surface distortion
- Ball deforms the surface where it hits
- Ripple effect propagates across the block
- When adjacent jello blocks lose a neighbor (block destroyed), remaining ones wiggle
- Physics-based wobble simulation in shader

### 🌀 Portal/Tunnel Block (Priority: Medium)
- Ball enters and tunnels through, exits other side
- Index of refraction effect - ball path bends
- Limited uses (1-3 passes before block breaks or becomes solid)
- **Metaball effect**: Block "reaches" toward approaching ball
- Cool entry/exit animations

### 👻 Translucent Blocks (Priority: Medium)
- See-through blocks with depth/glass effect
- Ball visible behind them
- Could combine with other block types
- Frosted glass vs clear glass variants

### 💎 Crystal Block (Idea)
- Refracts ball visually (ball appears offset inside)
- Shatters into particles when destroyed
- Prismatic rainbow edge effects

### ⚡ Electric Block (Idea)
- Arcs of electricity between nearby electric blocks
- Ball gets speed boost passing through
- Animated lightning effect

## Environment

### 🎨 Animated Backdrops
- Parallax starfields
- Nebula clouds (procedural noise)
- Wormhole/vortex effects
- Reactive to gameplay (pulse on hits, etc.)
- Multiple theme options

### 🌊 Arena Effects
- Heat distortion near explosive blocks
- Gravity lensing near black hole (already have basic version)
- Particle systems for:
  - Block destruction
  - Ball trail sparkles
  - Black hole consumption

## Audio Ideas (Future)
- Paddle hit sound
- Block break sounds (different per type)
- Black hole ambient hum
- Music that reacts to gameplay intensity

## Gameplay Ideas
- Power-ups that drop from blocks
- Multi-ball power-up
- Paddle size changes
- Slow-mo power-up
- Shield that protects black hole temporarily
